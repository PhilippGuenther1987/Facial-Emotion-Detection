Hi Everyone,

enjoy my work in jupyter notebook on that computer vision problem classifying facial emotion expressions using CNNs and TRansfer Learning

Feel free in reaching out to me for connecting, or better ways in doing it. Always hungry for new stuff.

In case of that uge dataset, I could not upload it here.

Happy-Data-Day

Best regards Philipp
